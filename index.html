<p class="text-muted">Your school is the institution you owe so much to. As a child you enter into school in kindergarten, and it is your teacher who teaches you the alphabets and the numbers in class. Year after year as you grow up and complete class after class you keep on learning, assimilating knowledge and developing a well-rounded personality.

  You also become more and more capable and equipped to do your duties and responsibilities as a good citizen and fine human being. Your teachers at school teach you with a great deal of care and concern and patience. When you are through with school, you are grateful to your school and all the teachers who shaped and moulded you into what you become. And you always carry fond memories of your alma mater.</p>

<p class="text-muted">A school auditorium is a central unit for addressing students, lectures, and gymnasium practices. The size of the auditorium depends on the use, function, and strength of the total students in school. A well-designed auditorium must be capable of accommodating at least half the total number of students in school.</p>

  You will find below a number of short and long paragraphs on Football. We hope these Football paragraphs will help students in completing their school assignments. These will also help children to write and read out paragraphs with simple words and small sentences. Students can select any paragraph on Football according to their particular requirement.</p>
